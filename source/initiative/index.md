        Initiative
    </h3>
    <p>
        The world is undergoing profound changes and facing severe challenges. In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, climate disasters, regional conflicts and violence, the global economy is confronted with the greatest challenges in decades. It is reported that around 702 million to 828 million people in the world faced starvation and nearly 2.37 billion could not obtain enough food in 2021. These afflictions especially struck low-income families, disabled individuals and marginal farmers in Africa and South Asia, where tens of millions children under the age of five still suffer from stunting, emaciation or being overweight. In 2022, the FAO food price index (FFPI) is running close to a record high.</p>
    <p>
        Governments, scientists, and international institutes around the world are working together to provide innovative strategies to address emerging and potential challenges. The young generation plays an important role in the governance of current global affairs, and will also be the future decision-makers in global affairs. Young scientists are an important force in continuing to promote global dialogue and multilateral cooperation, and are the most active and innovative force in tackling global food and inequality issues.</p>
    <p>
        We propose to establish the Young Scientists Association of Global Food Security (YSAGFS) to connect young scientists around the world. We hope the establishment of this platform can stimulate young scientists’ passion for communication, thinking and speaking out.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="p_bold">We are committed to promoting global food safety information exchange and sharing.</span> Only by being inclusive can we nurture the contributions and value of different civilizations and cultures in the world. The history and culture around the world have created unique characteristics of food and diets in different regions. By connecting young scientists from different regions and countries we uphold an open and inclusive mind, ready to promote the exchange of global food culture, popularize healthy diet patterns and actively improve the collection and analysis of food consumption data across regions and countries around the world.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="p_bold">We are committed to promoting the transformation and optimization of the global agri-food system. </span>We shall make use of our expertise and take actions to address the crucial problems of global food security in production, climate change and resource constraints, disasters and conflicts, and market and equity. We shall actively compare experimental data in different countries and regions to quickly assess the effectiveness of various food security programs, like new production technology promotion and grain saving and loss reduction, and their applicability in different regions, and promote the application of successful innovations to accelerate the realization of global food security goals.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="p_bold">We are committed to promoting the implementation of global food security initiatives.</span> We will hold academic forums or seminars on a regular or irregular basis, set up focus groups on global food security issues, provide summary views from conferences, or form research reports or papers series on food security issues in typical countries and regions, for the reference of global agricultural and food security research institutions, governments and research scholars.
We will consciously grow in promoting global food security governance. We will take the initiative to improve the global vision of young scientists and their responsibility for promoting the common development of all mankind and strive to become competent, compassionate young leaders who are committed to promoting world peace and development in future.</p>

    <p>
        Let us start with advancing our own behavior and work, and influence the people around us. We shall be responsible consumers and reduce food waste, for example, by practicing “Operation Empty Plate”. We will go out of the office to the fields and to the production workshops of agricultural products. We will provide decision-making suggestions for the communities, enterprises, and governments in the living circle. We will provide farmers and low-income people with knowledge on dietary nutrition, food conservation, and water conservation, etc.</p>
    <p>
        We believe that with the joint effort of peers, young scientists can better implement brainstorming and integration of ideas, accelerate theoretical and technological innovation, and provide new ideas and methods for global issues in public health, poverty reduction, food security, climate change, environmental pollution, and other fields. Together we strive to make the world a better place for generations to come.</p>
