        Global Food Security Association for Young Scientists
    </h3>
    <p>
        The world is undergoing profound changes and facing severe challenges.
        In recent years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, climate disasters, regional
        conflicts and violence, the global economy is confronted with the greatest
        challenges in decades. Global food security and nutrition status are deteriorating.
        Governments, scientists, and international institutes around the world
        are working together to provide innovative strategies to address emerging
        and potential challenges. The young generation plays an important role
        in the governance of current global affairs and will also be the future
        decision-makers in global affairs. Young scientists are an important force
        in continuing to promote global dialogue and multilateral cooperation and
        are the most active and innovative force in tackling global food and inequality
        issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Young Scientists Association of Global Food Security is established to
        connect young scientists around the world, working in the fields of food
        security such as climate change, agricultural systems, agricultural technologies,
        food production, agricultural trade and markets, and food consumption.
        The association is committed to providing an international platform to
        encourage young scientists to communicate, exchange ideas, and give voice
        to the world.
